- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Stchoud
- ðŸ‘€ I am a Mathematician graduate of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens pursuing my Masters in Applied Mathematics.
- ðŸŒ±  I am currently working on my thesis in Network Graph Theory in collaboration with the Mathematics Research Center of the Academy of Athens. It's aim is to explore novel bipartite networks that can reveal the relationships between different types of tumours and cancer genes. Findings of this work finding could have important implications for understanding cancer evolution.
